RETROSPECTIVE (Team 07)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done : 5 vs 4
- Total points committed vs done: 42 vs 37
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team): 112h vs 108h 15m 

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing: 
- Code review completed: 
- Code present on VCS: 
- End-to-End tests performed:

> Our DoD: A story is done when the backed tests performed by `jest` ends successfully and when the frontend tests performed by `cypress` are correctly completed.

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |    14   |    -   |      40h   |     56h30m   |
|*#1*    |     3   |   3    |      5h    |     4h30m    |
|*#2*    |     3   |   5    |      9h    |     11h50m   |
|*#3*    |     3   |  21    |      36h   |     9h30m    |
|*#4*    |     3   |   8    |      13h   |     26h50m   |
|*#5*    |     3   |   5    |      9h    |      0h      |

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation): 3h 43m
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent from previous table: 1,03

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube only for the selected and planned issues 
  - Hours spent on remediation 
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability")
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability )
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
